# This is Our Project for Senior Design EEL4924C
The goal of this project is to create a drone monitoring system. The goal is to have two parts, one being a handheld monitoring system, and the other being the hardware that wirelessly transmits information from the drone to the handheld device

# Handheld monitor
This compnent with be a handheld device that displays on an LCD informaiton about the drone in real time.

# Drone monitoring hardware
This is an extension of the flight controller building a dedicated flight controller with built in IR and RF comminication in mind. This is repsond to the controller and communicated critical drone data such as battery metrics, and position metrics
